TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_rx_clk is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_rx_clk. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-2#2 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_tx_clk is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_tx_clk. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_rx_clk is defined downstream of clock clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_tx_clk is defined downstream of clock clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_rx_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_rx_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_tx_clk and clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_tx_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_rx_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_rx_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_tx_clk and clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_tx_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hierarchical -filter {NAME =~*FIFO*/*rstblk*/*PRE}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '29' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

XDCB-5#2 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hierarchical -filter {NAME =~*_FIFO_II/USE_2N_DEPTH.V6_S6_AND_LATER.I_ASYNC_FIFO_BRAM/*rstblk*/*PRE}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '19' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
